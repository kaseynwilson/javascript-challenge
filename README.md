## Automatic Table and Date Search 

#### Using a UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to a web page and adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting in the dataset.

#### I used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events (click filter table button) and searches through the date/time column to find rows that match user input and filters based on that input.
